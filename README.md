## Critical Writing in Different Disciplines

**Source:** [University of Birmingham LibGuide](https://libguides.bham.ac.uk/c.php?g=654983&p=4603310)

This guide explains how critical writing varies across disciplines such as Film Studies, Geography, and Business Studies. It emphasizes that academic writing often combines both descriptive and critical elements, with critical analysis being key to achieving higher marks. The guide provides a simple model for critical writing, breaking it down into:

- **Description:** Provide context and background.
- **Analysis:** Explore relationships and alternatives.
- **Evaluation:** Draw implications, solutions, and recommendations.

> Critical writing, like all the rest of academic writing, exists in particular subject context. You can only learn to write critically within a given context or discipline.
